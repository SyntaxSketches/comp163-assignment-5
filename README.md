I wrote all code in Github, no I didn't use commtis such as "git add (python code name)
Overview:  
This assignment practiced different loops in Python. I wrote three programs using while, for, and nested loops, each chosen because it fit the problem.  

Challenge 1: Collatz Conjecture (While Loop)  
The program asks for a number and generates the Collatz sequence until it reaches 1. A while loop works because the number of steps is unknown. The program prints the sequence and counts the steps.  

Challenge 2: Prime Number Checker (For Loop)  
The program asks for a number and checks if it is prime. A for loop works because the range of divisors is known. If a divisor works, the number is not prime; if none work, it is prime.  

Challenge 3: Multiplication Table (Nested Loops)  
The program prints a multiplication table for 1â€“10. Nested loops handle rows and columns. The outer loop runs the rows and the inner loop calculates the products.  

Git Commits:  
I committed in stages. First was "Challenge 1: Collatz sequence.  Second was "Challenge 2: Prime checker. Third was "Challenge 3: Multiplication grid - nested loops for 2D data."  

AI Usage:  
I used ChatGPT for help with understanding the assignment, and syntax errrors (aka the testcases on zybooks)
